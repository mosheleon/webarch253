1. What HTTP command is used to make the /home resource respond with your full name (including spaces), the title of the page should be the full title of this class.
	The command: GET /home?name=Moshe%20Leon&title=Web%20Architecture%20253 HTTP/1.1

2. Use a PUT request to set the redirect target of http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~<USER>/server/wiki
	Using these lines would set the redirect address stored on the server (the last line is the address)

	PUT /wiki HTTP/1.1
	Host: localhost
	Content-Length: 22
	Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
	
	url=http://hotmail.com

        1. How do you verify this change?
		using these two lines would give me the redirect address stored on the server

		PUT /wiki HTTP/1.1
		Host: localhost

3. Use a POST to update the redirect target of http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~<USER>/server/wiki to a another new location.
	POST /wiki HTTP/1.1
	Host: localhost
	Content-Length: 20
	Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

	url=http://yahoo.com

4. Update app.py to correctly return an image from http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~<USER>/server/i253
        * Use your browser to test
		strangely enough, firefox and chrome did not display the pic, but internet explorer worked!
		"My friend Jim said i253 was fun" is the image text. 
        * Including the Content-Type in your submission
		content type is 'image/png'
