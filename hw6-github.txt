		       2) grep "login" member.json | wc -l						// to search the file and output occurences of my string

	Commands used: 1) curl -i "https://api.github.com/repos/yelp/mrjob/contributors" > contributors.json  // to send a curl GET command for my api call, and store in my file
		       2) grep "login" contributors.json | wc -l                                              // to search the file and output occurences of my string of choice 		        

4.Use the Commits resource to find what the message was of the first commit to the webarch253 repository owned by jblomo. 
	Answer: "initial"
	Command used: curl -i "https://api.github.com/repos/jblomo/webarch253/commits/9aae663bd3e6bfde4b16ee449e2a2e7653ba05e6"
	Explanation: I got the sha of the first commit from the repository page, going all the way to the begining. 
		     An alternative would be to keep using the 'until' parameter with an earlier date/time until the first
		     one is achieved.
