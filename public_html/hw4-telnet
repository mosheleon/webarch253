   1) Using 127.0.0.1 $FLASK_PORT
       1) What is the return code for GET /home HTTP/1.1?
		I am getting:
			127.0.0.1 - - [25/Sep/2014 17:34:13] "GET /home HTTP/1.1" 200 -
			HTTP/1.0 200 OK
			Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
			Content-Length: 228
			Server: Werkzeug/0.8.3 Python/2.7.3
			Date: Fri, 26 Sep 2014 00:34:13 GMT

			<!DOCTYPE html>
			<html lang="en-us">
				<head>
					<meta charset="utf-8">

					<link rel="stylesheet" href="static/css/default.css">
				</head>
				<body>
					<div class="container">
						Hello Jim
					</div>
				</body>
			</html>Connection closed by foreign host.

		Which is a response line with code 200 from the first line, which indicates success. 
		Then I am getting the content of the return parsed, with the length, content type, 
		server name, and the date. Right after I am getting the html recieved back. 

       2) What is the return code for GET /wiki HTTP/1.1?
		I am getting:
			127.0.0.1 - - [25/Sep/2014 17:38:32] "GET /wiki HTTP/1.1" 302 -
			HTTP/1.0 302 FOUND
			Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
			Content-Length: 253
			Location: http://en.wikipedia.org
			Server: Werkzeug/0.8.3 Python/2.7.3
			Date: Fri, 26 Sep 2014 00:38:32 GMT

			<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN">
			<title>Redirecting...</title>
			<h1>Redirecting...</h1>
			<p>You should be redirected automatically to target URL: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">http://en.wikipedia.org</a>.  If not click the link.Connection closed by foreign host.

		Which is a response to a redirect- 302, did not find required address but a 
		redirect to a different address, within the returned HTML.

            1) What is the next HTTP statement a browser would send after this return code? (provide the statement as you would type it into telnet)
		The browser will send an HTTP GET statement containing the new url from the parsed, recieved html 302 response.

       3) What is the return code for PUT /wiki HTTP/1.1?
		I am getting:
			127.0.0.1 - - [25/Sep/2014 17:48:56] "PUT /wiki HTTP/1.1" 200 -
			HTTP/1.0 200 OK
			Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
			Content-Length: 38
			Server: Werkzeug/0.8.3 Python/2.7.3
			Date: Fri, 26 Sep 2014 00:48:56 GMT

			Stored wiki => http://en.wikipedia.orgConnection closed by foreign host.

		Which means, that my PUT request was fine, due to 200 response, and the POST is doing something 
		on the server, which outputs a string message back of some placement in the database or any other hidden occurence.

   2) Explain what happens when your browser loads http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~<USER>/server/wiki from sending the request to loading HTML
		The browser will get the redirect instruction with a replacement address URL from the recieved HTML from the first GET and 
		initial URL response and redirect there by doing another GET request with the new URL.
 
   3) What is the return code for http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~<USER>/server/ ?
